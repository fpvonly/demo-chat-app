My focus has been heavily on the client side technologies (Javascript, React, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Flash) but I also have some experience in back-end development (Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB, PHP and MySQL).</p><p class='info_left'>This web-page you're looking at might seem just like a normal basic web-page at the first glance. However, that's not the case here. In fact, this thing is a single page web-app that has been created from scratch and is powered by the React framework. The whole thing is coded using ES6 features and bundled together using Webpack.</p><p class='info_left'>Behind the scenes, there's a Node.js server using the Expressjs-framework. And the chat below is using HTML5-standard's websockets for message broadcasting to other users. The messages are saved into a MongoDB database and the copies of the messages are also mailed to me.</p><p class='info_left'>When you log into the chat you can chat with other people who are in the chat at the moment and the messages will pop up instantly in everyone's browser. Test this for yourself by opening a second browser.</p>",
